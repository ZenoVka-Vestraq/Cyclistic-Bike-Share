# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-1
### Created to showcase my take on Google Capstone Case Study for Cyclistic Bike Share

## How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

This capstone case study on Cyclistic bike share is part of Google Data Analytics Professional course by Google on Coursera

## The data exploration, cleaning and analysis are done using:

1. Spreadsheets (Google Sheet and Microsoft Excel)
2. R Studio Cloud
3. Tableau

## Case Study Objective

Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights will be used to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual member as the company believes that the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships

## Brief background and summary of case study company

* Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company, their portfolio features multiple programs and projects. 
* Cyclistic owns a fleet of more than 5,824 bicycles and maintains 692 docking stations. 
* Cyclistic also has a unique value proposition, where they offer reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. This is part of a wider program that aims to make bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 
* The majority of users opt for traditional bikes, and about 8% of users opted for the assistive options. 
* Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
* Cyclistic operates mainly in the state of Illinois, Chicago City.

The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

## Questions to explore relating to business task:

### Main: 

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Sub: 

1. What are the biggest differences in behaviours between casual riders and annual members?
2. Are the differences in behaviours the reasons why casual riders stay casual, and annual members are willing to maintain their subscription?
3. What causes the differences in behaviours?

## Data Sources
Historical bike trip data provided by Motivate International Inc. under licence from Divvy Bikes. (The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company for the purpose of the Google Data Analytic Capstone project). Personal identifiable information are not available due to data-privacy.

Dataset was downloaded from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. For the purpose of this analysis, 12 months of data from May 2021 to April 2022 will be prepared and analysed. The most recent data available is April 2022. Total data size is approximately 1.61GB.

## Dataset was checked for credibility

* The dataset is assumed to be reliable (data is based on a fictitious entity), original, cited as it is provided under licence as above.
* Data is current as the most recent data used is April 2022
* There are missing data points for start station and end station and geographic latitude and longitude in the dataset therefore the data is not as comprehensive as it could have been. We will keep this in mind and account for these during data analysis.

## Documentation, Cleaning and Preparation of data for analysis
The combined size of all the 12 datasets is close to 1.61 GB. Data cleaning in spreadsheets will be time-consuming and slow compared to SQL or R. Chosed R simply because I could do both data wrangling and analysis/ visualizations in the same platform. It is also an opportunity for me to learn R better.

## Limitation/Assumptions made of data available

* No information on where users lives in the Cyclistic area of operations, this is due to data-privacy issues prohibit the use of users’ personally identifiable information.
* Analysis and insights will be limited on the casual rider’s behaviour as there are no data on types of purchase (single pass or full-day pass) and if there are multiple purchases from the same casual rider.
